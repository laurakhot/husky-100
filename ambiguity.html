    <h1>Embracing Ambiguity & Growth</h1>

    <p class="text-center">
      Some of the most valuable learning happens when we step outside our comfort zones and tackle
      challenges without clear answers. These experiences taught me resilience, problem-solving, and
      the importance of innovation in the face of uncertainty.

    <p class="text-center mb-lg">
      Here are the moments where I embraced ambiguity and grew as a developer, leader, and person.

    <!-- Ambiguity & Growth Stories -->
    <div class="section-block">
      <h2>🔥 Learning React & Firebase Under Pressure</h2>
      <p>
        For one of my Web Impact projects, I committed to building a full-stack application using
        React and Firebase—two technologies I had never used before. The client needed the platform
        live in 8 weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The Challenge:</strong> I had to learn React's component model, state management, hooks,
        and Firebase's authentication, database, and hosting—all while leading a team and communicating
        with a client who depended on us.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What I Did:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Spent nights and weekends working through tutorials and documentation</li>
        <li>Built small prototype features to understand the technologies before implementing full solutions</li>
        <li>Asked for help from peers and online communities when stuck</li>
        <li>Broke the project into small, achievable milestones to maintain momentum</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> I discovered I thrive under pressure when I have a clear purpose.
        This experience taught me that feeling lost is part of the learning process—what matters is
        staying curious and persistent. I also learned the value of building incrementally rather than
        trying to solve everything at once.
      </p>

      <h2>🤝 Navigating Unclear Client Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        One of my Web Impact clients struggled to articulate exactly what they needed. They knew their
        current website wasn't working, but they didn't have technical language to explain the problems
        or envision solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The Challenge:</strong> Building software with ambiguous requirements is risky—you might
        spend weeks building the wrong thing. I had to find ways to clarify needs without overwhelming
        a non-technical client.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What I Did:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Conducted user research by interviewing people who used the organization's services</li>
        <li>Created wireframes and prototypes to help the client visualize options</li>
        <li>Implemented iterative development with frequent check-ins and feedback loops</li>
        <li>Asked "why" questions to understand underlying needs, not just surface requests</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> Ambiguity in requirements is normal, especially when working
        with non-technical stakeholders. The solution isn't to demand perfect specifications—it's to
        build processes that embrace iteration and feedback. I learned that listening is just as important
        as coding.

      <h2>🐛 Debugging Mysterious Errors</h2>
      <p>
        During my time as a TA, I encountered countless bugs—both my own and students'. Some errors
        were straightforward, but others were cryptic, appearing randomly or only in specific environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The Challenge:</strong> One student's code worked perfectly on their machine but crashed
        on the grading server. After hours of investigation, we discovered the issue was related to
        file path differences between Windows and Unix systems—a problem neither of us had encountered
        before.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What I Did:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Systematically isolated variables to narrow down the problem</li>
        <li>Researched edge cases and platform-specific quirks</li>
        <li>Collaborated with other TAs to get fresh perspectives</li>
        <li>Documented the solution to help future students facing similar issues</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> Debugging teaches resilience. When you're stuck for hours on
        a single error, it's easy to feel frustrated or defeated. I learned to embrace the process,
        take breaks, and approach problems systematically. These skills have made me a better problem
        solver in all areas of life.

      <h2>🎓 Teaching Complex Concepts for the First Time</h2>
      <p>
        The first time I had to teach recursion, I felt completely unprepared. Recursion was one of
        those topics that "just made sense" to me, but I quickly realized explaining it to beginners
        was an entirely different challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The Challenge:</strong> How do you explain a concept so deeply ingrained in your thinking
        that you struggle to articulate the steps? My first attempts fell flat—students looked more
        confused than before.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What I Did:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Asked students what specifically confused them, rather than assuming I knew</li>
        <li>Created visual diagrams showing the call stack step by step</li>
        <li>Used physical objects (like Russian nesting dolls) to demonstrate recursive structure</li>
        <li>Practiced explaining the concept in multiple different ways</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> Expertise can be a barrier to teaching if you lose sight of
        the beginner's perspective. This experience taught me humility and the importance of continuous
        learning—even when teaching material I know well, there's always room to improve how I communicate
        it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-block">
      <h2>🚀 Building Features Beyond My Skill Level</h2>
      <p>
        Several Web Impact projects required features I didn't know how to build—payment processing,
        map integration, real-time data synchronization. Each time, I had to decide: should I find
        someone else, or figure it out myself?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The Challenge:</strong> Balancing confidence with humility. I wanted to grow my skills,
        but I also had a responsibility to deliver working solutions for real clients.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What I Did:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Researched extensively before committing to approaches</li>
        <li>Built proof-of-concept prototypes to validate feasibility</li>
        <li>Consulted with mentors and senior developers</li>
        <li>Set clear expectations with clients about timelines and risks</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> Growth requires calculated risks. Every expert was once a
        beginner, and the only way to develop new skills is to tackle challenges beyond your current
        abilities. I learned to be honest about what I don't know while staying confident in my ability
        to learn.

      <h2>🌱 Adapting to Rapid Changes in Technology</h2>
      <p>
        In the time I've been a CS student, I've watched frameworks rise and fall, best practices change,
        and new tools emerge constantly. What I learned in CSE 142 using Java felt outdated by the time
        I was building web apps with modern JavaScript frameworks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The Challenge:</strong> How do you build expertise when the landscape is constantly
        shifting? It's tempting to feel like you'll never "catch up" to everything there is to know.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What I Did:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Focused on learning fundamental concepts that transfer across technologies</li>
        <li>Embraced a mindset of continuous learning rather than seeking mastery</li>
        <li>Built small projects with new tools to stay current</li>
        <li>Connected with communities to learn what others are using and why</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> The most important skill in tech isn't knowing specific
        frameworks—it's the ability to learn new things quickly. By embracing change rather than
        resisting it, I've become more adaptable and confident in my ability to tackle unfamiliar
        challenges.

      <h2>Growth Through Discomfort</h2>
      <p>
        The moments where I felt most lost, frustrated, or overwhelmed were also the moments where I
        grew the most. Embracing ambiguity has taught me:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> Setbacks are temporary; persistence leads to breakthroughs</li>
        <li><strong>Innovation:</strong> Constraints and uncertainty force creative problem-solving</li>
        <li><strong>Humility:</strong> There's always more to learn, and that's exciting, not discouraging</li>
        <li><strong>Confidence:</strong> I can handle challenges I've never faced before</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These experiences embody the Husky 100 value of innovation—not just creating new things, but
        approaching problems with curiosity, adaptability, and a willingness to grow.
