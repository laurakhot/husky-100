      <h1>Welcome to My Husky 100 Portfolio</h1>

      <!-- <p>
        This portfolio showcases my journey as a University of Washington student, highlighting experiences
        that embody the Husky 100 criteria: leadership, innovation, connecting the dots, and making an impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout my time at UW, I've worked to make a difference through teaching, building accessible
        technology, and empowering others. From mentoring students as a TA to creating web solutions that
        help local businesses and organizations, each experience has shaped my understanding of what it means
        to be a Husky.
      </p> -->


      <p>My Husky experience has been defined by exploration and by connecting the dots between my diverse experiences from
        switching majors and engaging with new communities to taking on different jobs and tackling challenges across various disciplines. That curiosity became 
        the way I learn: questioning, experimenting, and finding meaning in the intersections of my experiences. 
      </p>

      <!-- What initially felt like uncertainty became the foundation of how I learn: by asking questions, testing boundaries, and seeking connections across experiences. -->

      <p>That spirit of exploration ultimately led me to Informatics, where I found language for what I had been practicing 
        all along: connecting technical knowledge with human-centered impact. At UW, I have come to see technology not just as a 
        academic discipline, but as a powerful tool for education, equity, and empowerment both inside and beyond the classroom. 
        This perspective was shaped most deeply through my work as a teaching assistant for CSE courses and my involvement in the
        Web Impact RSO, where I saw that learning does not stop at understanding a concept, it deepens
        when that knowledge is shared, applied, and adapted to real people and real needs.
      </p>
