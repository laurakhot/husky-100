      <h1>Welcome to My Husky 100 E-Portfolio</h1>

      <p>
        This portfolio showcases my journey as a University of Washington student, highlighting experiences
        that embody the Husky 100 criteria: leadership, innovation, connecting the dots, and making an impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout my time at UW, I've worked to make a difference through teaching, building accessible
        technology, and empowering others. From mentoring students as a TA to creating web solutions that
        help local businesses and organizations, each experience has shaped my understanding of what it means
        to be a Husky.
