    <h1>Teaching & Mentorship</h1>

    <p class="text-center">
      As a Teaching Assistant at the University of Washington, I've had the privilege of guiding
      hundreds of students through their journey in computer science. Each quarter brought new
      challenges, growth opportunities, and the chance to create spaces where
      struggling feels safe and asking questions feels welcome.

        <h3>CSE 123 - Intro to Programming III</h3>
        <p class="card-description">
          First quarter as a TA, supporting students learning Java fundamentals and problem-solving basics.

            <strong>Reflection:</strong> My first quarter as a TA was both exhilarating and humbling.
            I quickly learned that explaining concepts I took for granted required breaking down my
            thinking into digestible steps. One student struggled with loops for weeks, and watching
            them finally grasp the concept reminded me why I fell in love with programming in the
            first place.
          </p>
          <p>
            This experience taught me patience and the importance of meeting students where they are.
            I developed strategies for explaining abstract concepts using real-world analogies, which
            became a foundation for my teaching style.

            <strong>Reflection:</strong> CSE 163 allowed me to help students see the practical

            analyzing real datasets, which made the material feel relevant and impactful.

          <p>
            I particularly enjoyed guiding students through debugging complex data pipeline errors.
            These moments taught me the importance of systematic problem-solving and resilience—skills
            that extend far beyond programming. Watching students develop these skills has been
            incredibly fulfilling.

            <strong>Reflection:</strong> Each quarter as a TA has reinforced my passion for education
            and my commitment to making computer science accessible to all students. I've learned that
            great teaching isn't about having all the answers—it's about guiding students to discover
            answers themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moving forward, I'm excited to continue mentoring, develop new teaching materials, and
            explore ways to make CS education more inclusive and engaging. The relationships I've built
            with students and the growth I've witnessed make this one of the most meaningful parts of
            my UW experience.

      <h2>Impact & Growth</h2>
      <p>
        Over six quarters, I've supported over 500 students in their programming journey. Beyond
        teaching code, I've learned to foster growth mindsets, create inclusive learning environments,
        and adapt my approach to meet diverse learning needs.
