    <h1>Teaching & Mentorship</h1>

    <p class="text-center">
      As a Teaching Assistant at the University of Washington, I've had the privilege of guiding
      hundreds of students through their journey in computer science. Each quarter brought new
      challenges, growth opportunities, and the chance to make a lasting impact on students' lives.

        <h3>CSE 142 - Intro to Programming I</h3>
        <p class="card-description">
          First quarter as a TA, supporting students learning Java fundamentals and problem-solving basics.
        </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Reflection:</strong> My first quarter as a TA was both exhilarating and humbling.
            I quickly learned that explaining concepts I took for granted required breaking down my
            thinking into digestible steps. One student struggled with loops for weeks, and watching
            them finally grasp the concept reminded me why I fell in love with programming in the
            first place.
          </p>
          <p>
            This experience taught me patience and the importance of meeting students where they are.
            I developed strategies for explaining abstract concepts using real-world analogies, which
            became a foundation for my teaching style.
          </p>

        <h3>CSE 143 - Intro to Programming II</h3>
        <p class="card-description">
          Helped students master data structures, recursion, and object-oriented programming principles.
        </p>
        <p class="expand-hint">Click to read reflection →</p>
        <div class="card-details">
          <p>
            <strong>Reflection:</strong> CSE 143 presented more complex challenges, both for students
            and for me as an instructor. Recursion was particularly difficult to teach—it's one of those
            topics that either clicks immediately or requires a complete shift in thinking.
          </p>
          <p>
            I created visual diagrams and animated examples to help students visualize the call stack,
            which became popular study materials. This quarter reinforced the value of innovation in
            teaching—sometimes traditional explanations aren't enough, and you need to find creative
            ways to reach students.

      <!-- Card 3 -->
      <div class="ta-card card">
        <div class="card-meta">Spring 2024</div>
        <h3>CSE 154 - Web Programming</h3>
        <p class="card-description">
          Introduced students to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and building interactive web applications.
        </p>
        <p class="expand-hint">Click to read reflection →</p>
        <div class="card-details">
          <p>
            <strong>Reflection:</strong> Teaching web development was especially rewarding because
            students could immediately see the visual results of their work. I loved watching their
            excitement when they deployed their first website or created their first interactive feature.
          </p>
          <p>
            I emphasized accessibility from day one, teaching students to build with all users in mind.
            Many students told me this perspective changed how they thought about technology. This
            quarter connected my passion for accessible design with my role as an educator.

        <div class="card-meta">Autumn 2024</div>
        <h3>CSE 142 - Intro to Programming I</h3>
        <p class="card-description">
          Returned to CSE 142 with a year of teaching experience and refined pedagogical approaches.

        <p class="expand-hint">Click to read reflection →</p>
        <div class="card-details">
          <p>
            <strong>Reflection:</strong> Coming back to CSE 142 after teaching higher-level courses
            gave me new appreciation for the fundamentals. I brought lessons learned from teaching
            web development and data structures to make intro programming more engaging and relevant.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also took on more leadership responsibilities, mentoring newer TAs and helping redesign
            lab activities. This quarter was about connecting the dots between my experiences across
            different courses to become a more well-rounded educator.

        <div class="card-meta">Winter 2025</div>
        <h3>CSE 163 - Intermediate Data Programming</h3>
        <p class="card-description">
          Taught Python, pandas, data analysis, and testing—bridging programming fundamentals with real-world applications.
        </p>
        <p class="expand-hint">Click to read reflection →</p>
        <div class="card-details">
          <p>
            <strong>Reflection:</strong> CSE 163 allowed me to help students see the practical
            applications of programming in data science and research. Students worked on projects
            analyzing real datasets, which made the material feel relevant and impactful.
          </p>
          <p>
            I particularly enjoyed guiding students through debugging complex data pipeline errors.
            These moments taught me the importance of systematic problem-solving and resilience—skills
            that extend far beyond programming. Watching students develop these skills has been
            incredibly fulfilling.

            <strong>Reflection:</strong> Each quarter as a TA has reinforced my passion for education
            and my commitment to making computer science accessible to all students. I've learned that
            great teaching isn't about having all the answers—it's about guiding students to discover
            answers themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moving forward, I'm excited to continue mentoring, develop new teaching materials, and
            explore ways to make CS education more inclusive and engaging. The relationships I've built
            with students and the growth I've witnessed make this one of the most meaningful parts of
            my UW experience.
