    <p class="text-center">
      As a Teaching Assistant in CSE, I've had the privilege of guiding hundreds of students through their journey in computer science. Each quarter brought new challenges, growth opportunities, and the chance to create spaces where struggling feels safe and asking questions feels welcome.

            My first quarter as a TA was both exciting and humbling. I quickly learned that explaining concepts I took for granted required breaking down my thinking into digestible steps.

          <p>
            I learned that effective teaching relies on constant interaction, using direct student feedback to develop my teaching style.</p>

           DSA brings together students with widely varying experience, some with years of coding, others writing their first program. Remembering my own struggles as a student, I approached office hours by normalizing confusion, celebrating small wins, and reinforcing that where you start doesn’t define your potential.          </p>

            My first quarter as a lead TA gave me a unique perspective on the academic process. Designing exams and grading rubrics helped me see the other side of the classroom, giving me a clearer understanding of how course structure, assessments, and learning objectives fit together.
            Teaching and learning became two sides of the same coin.

            Taking on additional responsibilities as a TA allowed me to engage more deeply with the course content and support students more effectively. I created supplemental resources, including assignment guides, and led a guest lecture. The lecture was successful not because it was perfect, but because I embraced teaching as a collaborative, iterative process.

            <strong>Reflection:</strong> Each quarter as a TA has reinforced my passion for education
            and my commitment to making computer science accessible to all students. I've learned that
            great teaching isn't about having all the answers—it's about guiding students to discover
            answers themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moving forward, I'm excited to continue mentoring, develop new teaching materials, and
            explore ways to make CS education more inclusive and engaging. The relationships I've built
            with students and the growth I've witnessed make this one of the most meaningful parts of
            my UW experience.

      <h2>Impact & Growth</h2>
      <p>
        Over six quarters, I've supported over 500 students in their programming journey. Beyond
        teaching code, I've learned to foster growth mindsets, create inclusive learning environments,
        and adapt my approach to meet diverse learning needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        This experience embodies the Husky 100 values of <strong>leadership</strong> (mentoring and
        guiding students), <strong>innovation</strong> (creating new teaching materials and approaches),
        and <strong>making an impact</strong> (helping students succeed and discover their potential).
