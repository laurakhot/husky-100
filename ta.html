    <h1>Teaching & Mentorship</h1>

    <p class="text-center">
      As a Teaching Assistant at the University of Washington, I've had the privilege of guiding
      hundreds of students through their journey in computer science. Each quarter brought new
      challenges, growth opportunities, and the chance to create spaces where
      struggling feels safe and asking questions feels welcome.

            <strong>Reflection:</strong> My first quarter as a TA was both exciting and humbling.
            I quickly learned that explaining concepts I took for granted required breaking down my
            thinking into digestible steps.
          </p>
          <p>
            Student feedback helped me develop strategies for explaining abstract concepts using real-world analogies, which
            became a foundation for my teaching style.

            <strong>Reflection:</strong> This course is often used to prepare students for technical interviews, especially during peak recruiting season. 
            I focused on equitable education to support students with varying skill levels. Some arrived with years of coding experience, while others were 
            writing their first program. My role as a TA was to meet each student where they were and help them grow, regardless of their starting point.

            <strong>Reflection:</strong> My first quarter as a lead TA gave me a unique perspective on the academic process. Designing exams and grading rubrics
             helped me see the other side of the classroom, giving me a clearer understanding of how course structure, assessment, and learning objectives fit together. 
             This insight connected to my other classes, allowing me to appreciate the full picture of the education pipeline.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, I had to put myself in the students’ shoes, anticipating where they might struggle and how to guide them effectively.
            <!-- Seeing the classroom from both sides gave me a fuller view of education and strengthened my ability to support learning. -->

            <strong>Reflection:</strong> Taking on additional responsibilities as a TA allowed me to engage deeply with the course content and support students more effectively. 
            Becoming very familiar with the material gave me confidence to create new resources, including assignment guides, and to lead a guest lecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Focussing on enhancing the course reinforced my view of teaching as a collaborative and iterative process, 
            highlighting how thoughtfully designed guidance can amplify learning.

            <strong>Reflection:</strong> Each quarter as a TA has reinforced my passion for education
            and my commitment to making computer science accessible to all students. I've learned that
            great teaching isn't about having all the answers—it's about guiding students to discover
            answers themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moving forward, I'm excited to continue mentoring, develop new teaching materials, and
            explore ways to make CS education more inclusive and engaging. The relationships I've built
            with students and the growth I've witnessed make this one of the most meaningful parts of
            my UW experience.

      <h2>Impact & Growth</h2>
      <p>
        Over six quarters, I've supported over 500 students in their programming journey. Beyond
        teaching code, I've learned to foster growth mindsets, create inclusive learning environments,
        and adapt my approach to meet diverse learning needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        This experience embodies the Husky 100 values of <strong>leadership</strong> (mentoring and
        guiding students), <strong>innovation</strong> (creating new teaching materials and approaches),
        and <strong>making an impact</strong> (helping students succeed and discover their potential).
