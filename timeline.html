          <h3>Admitted as ENGRUD</h3>
          <p>
            Started my journey at UW as an Engineering Undeclared student, initially intending to study bioengineering.
          </p>
          <div class="timeline-details">
            <p>
              This open-ended beginning set the stage for exploration across different engineering paths. Being undeclared gave me the freedom to discover what truly resonated with me.

          <h3>Took CSE 121: Academic Turning Point</h3>
          <p>
            What started as a prerequisite became a transformative struggle. Despite initial challenges with this entirely new subject, I discovered a passion for computing and problem-solving through code.
          </p>
          <div class="timeline-details">
            <p>
              <strong>Impact on Learning:</strong> Coding was entirely new to me, and the learning curve was steep. I spent lots of time in office hours and my scores reflected my struggle. But with persistence, concepts that once felt impossible started clicking. 
               This course taught me that confusion isn't failure, it's an indication of growth. Looking back at my 
               first progamming assignments, its rewarding to see how far I've come.

          <h3>Declared ECE Major</h3>
          <p>
            Placed into Electrical and Computer Engineering, a technical path that would later reveal its limitations for me.
          </p>
          <div class="timeline-details">
            <p>
              ECE gave me rigorous systems-level thinking and technical problem-solving skills. But as I progressed, I realized I was drawn to more user-centric technology. Still, this technical
              foundation proved crucial to everything that followed.

          <h3>Joined Web Impact</h3>
          <p>
            A friend suggested I check out this RSO. I showed up hoping to learn web development and left with a new understanding of why technical skills matter.
          </p>
          <div class="timeline-details">
            <p>
              <strong>Connecting Classroom to Community:</strong> This marked the beginning of understanding technology as a tool for real-world impact. Working on community-driven projects showed me how technical skills could directly serve local businesses and non-profits, connecting classroom learning with tangible outcomes.

          <h3>Started TAing</h3>
          <p>
            Became a Teaching Assistant for CSE courses and discovered that teaching transforms the teacher as much as the student.
          </p>
          <div class="timeline-details">
            <p>
              <strong>Connecting the Dots:</strong> Remember my CSE 121 struggle? Now I was on the other side, watching students experience the same confusion I once felt. I let those past challenges guide me, realizing they made me a more empathetic TA.

          <h3>Became Web Impact Coding Officer</h3>
          <p>
            Stepped into leadership at Web Impact and saw how my TA skills transferred to a completely different context.
          </p>
          <div class="timeline-details">
            <p>
              <strong>Transferring Learning:</strong> As a Coding Officer, I lead workshops and mentored teams, applying the same skills from TAing: breaking down complex concepts, meeting people where they are, and fostering inclusive environments. Using these skills in a new context showed me their versatility and impact.</p>

          <h3>Switched to Informatics</h3>
          <p>
            Changed majors after two years in engineering, a risk that ultimately paid off.
          </p>
          <div class="timeline-details">
            <p>
              <strong>Embracing Ambiguity Again:</strong> Switching majors meant accepting uncertainty for the second time in my college journey. But my experiences showed me that I care not only about building technology, but also about understanding how it serves people. This taught me that finding your path requires the courage to change direction.

          <p>
            Now leading the organization that first showed me what purposeful technology looks like.
          </p>
          <div class="timeline-details">
            <p>
              <strong>Full Circle:</strong> As President, I'm creating for others the same growth experience Web Impact gave me. My decisions are informed by 
              lessons from my journey: that struggle with adequate support builds resilience, that uncertainty can be embraced, and that leadership means helping
               others find their own path.

          <h3>What's Next</h3>
          <p>
            My Husky experience taught me to how to handle uncertainty and remain open-minded to new oppurtunities.
          </p>
          <div class="timeline-details">
            <p>
              <strong>Prepared for Ambiguity:</strong> I don't know exactly what's next, but UW taught me to embrace the unknown by asking questions, seeking mentors, and trusting that persistence pays off.
