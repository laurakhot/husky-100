          <h3>Admitted as ENGRUD</h3>
          <p>
            Started my journey at UW as an Engineering Undeclared student, initially intending to study bioengineering.
          </p>
          <div class="timeline-details">
            <p>
              This open-ended beginning set the stage for exploration across different engineering paths. Being undeclared gave me the freedom to discover what truly resonated with me, rather than committing to a path before understanding my options.

          <h3>Took CSE 121: Academic Turning Point</h3>
          <p>
            What started as a prerequisite quickly became a turning point in my journey. Despite initial struggles with this entirely new subject,
            I discovered a passion for computing and problem-solving through code.
          </p>
          <div class="timeline-details">
            <p>
              <strong>Impact on Learning:</strong> CSE 121 taught me that confusion isn't failure—it's the first step toward understanding. Office hours, debugging sessions that lasted hours, and breaking problems into smaller pieces built my resilience and systematic thinking skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Personal Growth:</strong> This course fundamentally changed how I approach challenges, showing me that with persistence and the right support, I could master skills that once seemed impossible. This growth mindset became the foundation for everything that followed—from TAing to leading Web Impact.

          <h3>Declared ECE Major</h3>
          <p>
            Officially placed into the Electrical and Computer Engineering major, diving deeper into hardware and software systems.
          </p>
          <div class="timeline-details">
            <p>
              This technical foundation proved crucial for everything that followed. ECE courses gave me the systems-level thinking and problem-solving skills that I would later apply in both teaching and client projects.

          <h3>Joined Web Impact</h3>
          <p>
            Began attending Web Impact workshops on a friend's suggestion, hoping to learn new web development skills.
          </p>
          <div class="timeline-details">
            <p>
              <strong>Out-of-Class Experience:</strong> This marked the beginning of understanding technology as a tool for real-world impact. Working on community-driven projects showed me how technical skills could directly serve local businesses and non-profits, connecting classroom learning with tangible outcomes.

          <h3>Started TAing</h3>
          <p>
            Began my role as a Teaching Assistant, supporting students in learning software development.
          </p>
          <div class="timeline-details">
            <p>
              <strong>Connecting the Dots:</strong> This role transformed how I think about learning and communication. The best way to truly understand something is to teach it—and teaching requires breaking down complex concepts, meeting students where they are, and creating safe spaces for struggle. These skills directly informed how I later mentored developers at Web Impact.

          <h3>Became Web Impact Coding Officer</h3>
          <p>
            Stepped into leadership, mentoring technical teams and leading workshops.
          </p>
          <div class="timeline-details">
            <p>
              <strong>Leadership:</strong> As Coding Officer, I bridged my teaching experience with web development. Leading workshops and mentoring teams taught me that leadership isn't about having all the answers—it's about creating environments where others can learn and grow. My TA experience directly informed how I supported other developers.

          <h3>Switched to Informatics</h3>
          <p>
            Made the decision to pursue Informatics to focus on human-centered technology.
          </p>
          <div class="timeline-details">
            <p>
              <strong>Finding Purpose:</strong> Switching majors was a risk, but it allowed me to find language for what I'd been practicing all along: connecting technical skills with meaningful impact. Informatics aligned with my values around accessibility, equity, and creating solutions with real-world purpose.

            Now leading the organization that helped me discover my purpose.

          <div class="timeline-details">
            <p>
              <strong>Making Impact:</strong> As President, I lead student teams to deliver digital solutions for local businesses and community organizations. This role brings together everything I've learned about teaching, technology, and leadership. I'm shaping the club's vision while creating space for others to experience the same growth I did.

          <h3>What's Next</h3>
          <p>
            My Husky Experience has taught me to embrace uncertainty as opportunity.
          </p>
          <div class="timeline-details">
            <p>
              <strong>Ready for the Future:</strong> I'm ready for whatever comes next—whether that's building accessible technology, teaching, or discovering new ways to create impact. Backed by strong communities and relationships from UW, I know how to find the resources and people to navigate new challenges. The risk of failure doesn't deter me; it energizes me to pursue goals with both savvy and fortitude.
