    <h1>Web Impact Projects</h1>

    <p class="text-center">
      Through Web Impact, I've had the opportunity to lead development teams and create web solutions
      for real clients—non-profits, small businesses, and community organizations that need technology
      but lack the resources to build it themselves.
    </p>

    <p class="text-center mb-lg">
      These projects taught me leadership, client communication, and how to navigate ambiguity while
      delivering solutions that make a tangible difference in people's lives.

        <h3>Local Non-Profit Website Redesign</h3>
        <p class="card-meta">Fall 2023 • Team Lead</p>
        <p class="card-description">
          Led a team of 4 developers to redesign and rebuild a website for a Seattle-based non-profit
          serving underserved youth. Focused on accessibility, mobile responsiveness, and easy content
          management for non-technical staff.
        </p>
        <div class="card-details">
          <p>
            <strong>Impact:</strong> The new website increased volunteer sign-ups by 40% and made it
            easier for families to access resources. The organization's director told us it transformed
            their ability to serve the community.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Leadership Lesson:</strong> I learned to balance technical excellence with client
            needs, delegate tasks based on team members' strengths, and communicate technical concepts
            to non-technical stakeholders. Leading this project taught me that the best solutions come
            from truly understanding the people you're serving.

      <div class="card project-card">
        <h3>Small Business E-Commerce Platform</h3>
        <p class="card-meta">Winter 2024 • Full-Stack Developer</p>
        <p class="card-description">
          Built an online store for a local artisan bakery, including inventory management, online
          ordering, and payment processing integration. Used React, Node.js, and Firebase.
        </p>
        <div class="card-details">
          <p>
            <strong>Impact:</strong> Enabled the bakery to expand beyond in-person sales, reaching
            customers throughout the Seattle area. During our first month live, online orders accounted
            for 25% of their revenue.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Technical Growth:</strong> This project pushed me to learn full-stack development,
            handle real payment transactions securely, and optimize performance for mobile users.
            Working with real business constraints taught me to prioritize features and deliver MVP
            solutions quickly.

        <h3>Community Event Management System</h3>
        <p class="card-meta">Spring 2024 • Technical Lead</p>
        <p class="card-description">
          Developed a custom event management platform for a community center to organize classes,
          workshops, and events. Features included registration, payment processing, and automated
          email confirmations.
        </p>
        <div class="card-details">
          <p>
            <strong>Impact:</strong> Streamlined the registration process for hundreds of community
            members, reducing administrative work by 60% and making programs more accessible to
            low-income families through scholarship features.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Innovation:</strong> We built custom accessibility features including screen reader
            support and simplified forms for users with varying digital literacy levels. This project
            showed me how thoughtful design can remove barriers and expand access.

          <p>
            <strong>Connecting the Dots:</strong> This project combined my technical skills with my
            passion for environmental issues. I learned how technology can amplify important messages

      <h2>What I've Learned</h2>
      <p>
        Web Impact projects have taught me that great software engineering isn't just about writing
        clean code—it's about understanding real problems, collaborating effectively, and creating
        solutions that genuinely help people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through these experiences, I've developed:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Leadership skills:</strong> Managing teams, communicating with clients, and delivering projects on time</li>
        <li><strong>Technical versatility:</strong> Full-stack development, database design, API integration, and deployment</li>
        <li><strong>Problem-solving:</strong> Working with ambiguous requirements and adapting to changing needs</li>
        <li><strong>Empathy:</strong> Understanding users' needs and building accessible, inclusive solutions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These projects embody the Husky 100 values of making an impact, connecting skills across
        disciplines, and using innovation to serve communities.
