    <h1>What's Next</h1>

    <p class="text-center">
      My time at UW has prepared me to make an impact in software engineering, accessibility, and
      education. As I look to the future, I'm excited to carry forward the lessons I've learned and
      continue growing as a technologist and leader.
    </p>

    <div class="section-block mt-lg">
      <h2>🚀 Career Goals: Software Engineering with Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        I'm pursuing a career in software engineering where I can build products that make a meaningful
        difference in people's lives. Through my Web Impact projects and TA experience, I've discovered
        that the most rewarding work comes from solving real problems for real people.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What I'm Looking For:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Organizations that prioritize user impact over vanity metrics</li>
        <li>Teams that value accessibility and inclusive design</li>
        <li>Opportunities to mentor and grow junior developers</li>
        <li>Work that connects technology with social good</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>How UW Prepared Me:</strong> Through courses like CSE 154 (Web Programming), CSE 163
        (Data Programming), and real-world client work, I've built a strong technical foundation across
        full-stack development, data analysis, and software design. More importantly, my TA experience
        taught me communication, leadership, and how to break down complex problems—skills that matter
        just as much as coding ability.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-block">
      <h2>♿ Continuing the Accessibility Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Accessibility will remain central to my work. Building the AltVision extension opened my eyes
        to how much of the digital world remains inaccessible to people with disabilities. This isn't
        just a technical problem—it's a matter of equity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Future Goals:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Advocate for accessibility-first design in every organization I join</li>
        <li>Continue developing AltVision and expanding its features</li>
        <li>Contribute to open-source accessibility tools and frameworks</li>
        <li>Mentor others on building inclusive technology</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>How UW Prepared Me:</strong> Through Web Impact projects, I learned to design with
        diverse users in mind from day one. Teaching web development as a TA allowed me to share
        accessibility principles with the next generation of developers. These experiences taught me
        that accessibility is everyone's responsibility, not just a specialist's job.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-block">
      <h2>🎓 Education & Mentorship</h2>
      <p>
        Teaching has been one of the most fulfilling parts of my college experience. Whether I'm
        working as a formal educator or mentoring junior engineers, I want to continue helping others
        discover their potential in technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Future Goals:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Continue mentoring students and early-career developers</li>
        <li>Expand outreach programs that bring coding to underrepresented communities</li>
        <li>Create educational content (tutorials, blog posts, videos) to share knowledge</li>
        <li>Perhaps return to formal education or teaching later in my career</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>How UW Prepared Me:</strong> Six quarters as a TA taught me pedagogy, patience, and
        how to meet learners where they are. I learned that great teaching isn't about knowing
        everything—it's about creating environments where students feel safe to struggle, ask questions,
        and grow. These lessons will guide my mentorship throughout my career.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-block">
      <h2>🌍 Community Impact & Service</h2>
      <p>
        The most meaningful projects I've worked on have been those that serve communities in need.
        I want to continue using technology as a tool for positive change, whether through volunteer
        work, pro-bono projects, or choosing employers whose missions align with my values.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Future Goals:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stay involved with Web Impact or similar organizations</li>
        <li>Build technology solutions for non-profits and community organizations</li>
        <li>Advocate for ethical tech practices within the industry</li>
        <li>Support digital literacy initiatives in underserved communities</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>How UW Prepared Me:</strong> Web Impact showed me that even as a student, I have skills
        that can help real organizations make a difference. Working with clients from diverse backgrounds
        taught me to listen deeply, communicate clearly, and build solutions that truly serve user needs.
        These experiences proved that technology can be a force for equity when used intentionally.

      <h2>💡 Continuous Learning & Innovation</h2>
      <p>
        Technology evolves rapidly, and staying relevant means committing to lifelong learning. I'm
        excited to continue exploring new tools, frameworks, and paradigms while deepening my expertise
        in areas I'm passionate about.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Areas I'm Exploring:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Advanced web accessibility and assistive technologies</li>
        <li>Machine learning applications for social good</li>
        <li>Design systems and component libraries</li>
        <li>Performance optimization and scalability</li>
        <li>Developer tools and productivity enhancements</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>How UW Prepared Me:</strong> From learning React and Firebase under pressure to debugging
        mysterious errors as a TA, I've developed the resilience and resourcefulness to tackle unfamiliar
        challenges. UW taught me that feeling lost is part of growth—what matters is staying curious
        and persistent.

      <h2>🌸 Reflecting on the Journey</h2>
      <p>
        Looking back on my time at UW, I'm struck by how much I've grown—not just as a developer, but
        as a leader, educator, and person. The Husky 100 criteria—leadership, innovation, connecting
        the dots, and making an impact—aren't just abstract values. They're woven throughout every
        experience in this portfolio:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Leadership:</strong> Guiding students as a TA and leading Web Impact project teams</li>
        <li><strong>Innovation:</strong> Embracing new technologies and creative teaching approaches</li>
        <li><strong>Connecting the dots:</strong> Bridging technical skills with empathy, creativity, and purpose</li>
        <li><strong>Making an impact:</strong> Building accessible tools and serving underserved communities</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I'm proud of what I've accomplished, and I'm excited about what comes next. The skills, values,
        and connections I've built at UW will guide me as I step into the next chapter of my journey.
