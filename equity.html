    <h1>Equity & Access</h1>

    <p class="text-center">
      Technology should empower everyone, not just those with the resources or abilities that we often
      assume are standard. Throughout my time at UW, I've worked to break down barriers and create
      opportunities for underrepresented and underserved communities.
    </p>

    <p class="text-center mb-lg">
      From teaching kids to code to building accessibility tools, these experiences have shaped my
      understanding of what it means to be an ethical and responsible technologist.
    </p>

      <h2>💻 Coding with Kids</h2>
      <p>
        I've volunteered with several organizations that teach coding to K-12 students, particularly
        those from underrepresented backgrounds in tech. These programs introduce programming through
        creative projects like game design, robotics, and web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Impact:</strong> Worked with over 50 students across multiple workshops, many of whom
        had never written a line of code before. Seeing their excitement when they built their first
        game or website reminded me why representation in tech matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Reflection:</strong> Many of these students told me they didn't think "people like them"
        could be programmers. Breaking down those misconceptions and showing students they belong in
        tech has been one of the most meaningful parts of my college experience. I've learned that
        access isn't just about resources—it's about seeing yourself reflected in the field.

      <h2>♿ AltVision Accessibility Extension</h2>
      <p>
        Developed a browser extension that enhances web accessibility for users with visual impairments.
        Features include customizable text-to-speech, high-contrast modes, font size adjustment, and
        automatic image description generation using AI.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Impact:</strong> Used by over 200 people in beta testing, with feedback that it made
        previously inaccessible websites usable. One user told me the extension allowed them to
        independently browse news sites for the first time in years.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Reflection:</strong> This project taught me that accessibility is not an afterthought—it
        should be built into technology from the start. Working with users who rely on assistive
        technology opened my eyes to the countless barriers that exist in the digital world. Every
        website I build now, I think about accessibility first.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Technical Learning:</strong> Implemented ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader
        optimization, and semantic HTML. Learned about WCAG guidelines and the importance of testing
        with actual assistive technology users.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-block">
      <h2>🎓 Mentoring & Office Hours</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond formal TA responsibilities, I've made it a priority to create welcoming and inclusive
        spaces in my office hours and mentoring sessions. This includes being mindful of imposter
        syndrome, creating judgement-free environments, and actively encouraging students from
        underrepresented backgrounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Impact:</strong> Several students have told me that my office hours were the first time
        they felt comfortable asking "basic" questions without fear of judgment. Creating safe learning
        environments has helped students who might otherwise drop out of CS persist and succeed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Reflection:</strong> Equity in education means recognizing that not all students start
        from the same place. Some students come to college with years of coding experience, while others
        are writing their first program. My job as a TA is to meet students where they are and help
        them grow, regardless of their starting point.

      <h2>🌍 Community Technology Workshops</h2>
      <p>
        Organized and led free technology workshops for community members, covering topics like basic
        computer literacy, online safety, job application skills, and intro to coding. Partnered with
        local libraries and community centers to reach underserved populations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Impact:</strong> Served over 30 community members, including older adults, immigrants,
        and low-income individuals. Many participants told us these skills helped them apply for jobs,
        connect with family, or navigate essential services online.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Reflection:</strong> Digital literacy is increasingly essential, yet many people lack
        access to training. These workshops reminded me that the "digital divide" is very real and that
        technologists have a responsibility to share knowledge beyond traditional educational settings.
        I learned to adapt my teaching to audiences with vastly different backgrounds and learning needs.
      </p>

    <div class="section-block">
      <h2>🔍 Inclusive Design in Every Project</h2>
      <p>
        In all my Web Impact projects and personal work, I've made inclusive design a priority. This
        means considering diverse users from the start: people with disabilities, non-native English
        speakers, users with limited internet bandwidth, and those with varying levels of technical
        literacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Principles I Follow:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Design for screen readers and keyboard navigation from day one</li>
        <li>Use clear, simple language and avoid jargon</li>
        <li>Ensure color contrast meets WCAG standards</li>
        <li>Optimize for slow connections and older devices</li>
        <li>Provide multiple ways to accomplish tasks</li>
        <li>Test with real users from diverse backgrounds</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Reflection:</strong> Inclusive design makes products better for everyone, not just
        users with specific needs. Features built for accessibility—like captions, keyboard shortcuts,
        and clear navigation—benefit all users. This perspective has fundamentally changed how I approach
        software development.

      <h2>Why Equity & Access Matter</h2>
      <p>
        Technology has incredible power to improve lives, but it can also reinforce existing inequalities
        if we're not intentional about who we're building for. I've learned that creating equitable
        technology requires:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Empathy:</strong> Understanding the diverse experiences and challenges users face</li>
        <li><strong>Representation:</strong> Ensuring diverse voices are part of the design process</li>
        <li><strong>Intentionality:</strong> Making accessibility and inclusion priorities, not afterthoughts</li>
        <li><strong>Education:</strong> Sharing knowledge and opportunities with underserved communities</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These experiences embody the Husky 100 value of making a positive impact by removing barriers
        and creating opportunities for all people to thrive.
